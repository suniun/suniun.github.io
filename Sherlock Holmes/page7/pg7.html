<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where the letters are without looking." Then, suddenly realizing the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. "You've heard about me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how could you know all that?"</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?"</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. "Yes, I did bang out of the house," she said, "for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank -- that is, my father -- took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your father," said Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the name is different."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself. "</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And your mother is alive?"</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got 4700 pounds for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't near as much as father could have got if he had been alive."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the business?"</p>
