<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/2 per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about 60 pounds."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a-day."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes. "This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. "I met him first at the gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him -- that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No?"</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. He wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?"</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know."</p>
